# Project-Winux

## Warning
Use at your own risk. I have been doing all of my testing of this project in a virtual machine so as to not harm my computer. I have a feeling that my program is entirely benign but you can never be too careful. This program will kill Explorer.exe by unorthodox means which is part of its design. I am just not too sure if the method I use is safe.

## The Goal
If you want a highly performant OS these days you are stuck with three options: MacOS, Windows, and Linux. The latter two are my favorite. Windows has great sosftware compatibility and Linux is highly customizable. The idea of Project Winux is to create a library that allows users to override Windows' default GUI and make deep customizations that are not normally possible. This perfectly retains the aforementioned software compatibility of Windows while bringing the customizability of Linux to the table. Don't like the Start menu? Change the way it looks and functions. Don't like the Notification Center? Remove it. Want something more robust than Notepad? Replace it. Project Winux is the successor of [Active Overlay](https://github.com/ndnestor/Active-Overlay).

## Technologies
This is a WPF project which requires the .NET Framework to be installed to use it. [It can be downloaded here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework). The latest version of the .NET Framework that has been teseted with this library is 4.8.

## Project Status
The development of Project Winux is currently on pause. I am currently quite busy with school and other projects that I am working on. I intend to come back to this project and start from scratch as I no longer believe that WPF is the correct framework to use for this application. I am especially okay with starting over as I have not made much progress programmatically speaking. Most of the work that I have done on this project has been the planning of the various bits and pieces of this project.
